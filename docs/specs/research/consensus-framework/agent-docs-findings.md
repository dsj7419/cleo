## 1. Internal Consistency Issues

| Section A | Section B | Contradiction | Severity |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Executive Summary (L13) | Per Phase Agent Count (L156-163) | Exec summary says "5 specialist agents", table shows 7 total (1 orchestrator + 5 workers + 1 synthesis) | MEDIUM |
| Phase 2 Subtasks (L37-44) | Per Phase Agent Count (L158-161) | Phase 2 Subtasks lists 5 agents (T190-T194), Agent Count table confirms 5 workers, but changelog L928 says "6 agents" for subagent mappings | MEDIUM |
| Round-Robin Protocol (L88) | Main Agent Architecture (L104) | Round-Robin shows 6+15+7+3+2=33 agents across 5 rounds; main architecture shows 7 agents across 4 phases. Unclear if Round-Robin is alternative or extension | HIGH |
| Phase Structure (L22-27) | Position Identification (L810-817) | Phase 3 task is T195, but L815 says "T195 = Phase 3 start" while Phase 3 Subtasks (L46-51) lists T196-T198. T195 never defined in subtasks. | HIGH |
| Phase 4 Subtasks (L53-59) | Position Identification (L816-817) | Phase 4 start is T199, subtasks are T200-T203, but Phase Structure (L27) shows T199 depends on T196-T198 (Phase 3 subtasks), not T195 | MEDIUM |

### Critical Gap: T195 Missing Definition

The task T195 is referenced as "Phase 3 start" in Position Identification (L814) but is never defined in any subtask table. This creates an orphan reference.

**Evidence**:
- L26: `| **Phase 3** | T195 | Challenge & Consensus | T190,T191,T192,T193,T194 |`
- L46-51: Phase 3 Subtasks lists T196, T197, T198 only
- T195 appears in structure but has no definition in subtasks

## 2. Accuracy Issues

| Claim | Reality | Location |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `claudedocs/CONSENSUS-FRAMEWORK-SPEC.md` path referenced | File does NOT exist at this path. Actual location: `docs/specs/CONSENSUS-FRAMEWORK-SPEC.md` | L581, L763 |
| `doc-corrections.diff` file format | Actual file is `doc-corrections.md` (markdown, not diff format) | L690, L417 |
| `synthesis-round1.md` referenced as output | File does NOT exist in `claudedocs/consensus/` directory | L665 |
| 6 subagent type mappings (L928) | Table at L400-407 shows exactly 6 rows, so count is correct. However, this contradicts "5 worker agents" claim elsewhere. | L928 vs L104 |
| Subagent type `requirements-analyst` for Challenge Agent | This is a valid persona type, but mapping rationale ("systematic discovery, ambiguity detection") overlaps with Technical Validator | L406 |

### Path Discrepancy Analysis

The spec references its own location incorrectly in session recovery instructions:

```
# Line 581
cat claudedocs/CONSENSUS-FRAMEWORK-SPEC.md

# Line 763
cat claudedocs/CONSENSUS-FRAMEWORK-SPEC.md
```

**Actual location**: `docs/specs/CONSENSUS-FRAMEWORK-SPEC.md`

This would cause session recovery failure if followed literally.

## 3. Completeness Gaps

| Missing Element | Where Needed | Impact |
|----------------|--------------|--------|
| T195 task definition | Phase 3 Subtasks table (L46-51) | Breaks task tracking consistency; orphan task reference |
| HITL acronym expansion before first use | First use at L234, expansion at L467 | Reader must scroll 233 lines to understand acronym |
| R-squared (R squared) explanation | L219 "R greater than 0.9" threshold | Technical readers may not know acceptable regression threshold |
| Phase boundary task IDs summary | Quick Start section (L884-905) | No single table showing all phase-to-task mappings |
| Round-Robin vs Main Architecture relationship | Round-Robin Protocol section (L82-92) | Unclear if Round-Robin is alternative protocol or extends the main 4-phase model |
| Gate response time units | L487, L496, L504, L513 | Times listed as "24 hours", "48 hours" without timezone or SLA context |
| Evidence standard for "CONTESTED" verdict | Consensus Rules (L213) | Only defines vote split, not what evidence qualifies as valid for contested claims |

### Missing Cross-Reference: Phase Task ID Summary

The document contains multiple tables mapping tasks to phases, but no consolidated single-reference table exists. Readers must cross-reference:
- Phase Structure (L22-27)
- Phase 1-4 Subtasks (L29-59)
- Position Identification (L809-817)

A consolidated table would reduce navigation overhead.

## 4. LLM Instruction Quality

**Overall Grade**: B

### Strengths

1. **Structured Output Templates** (L307-380): Clear markdown templates with explicit sections reduce ambiguity.

2. **Role Separation Table** (L123-129): Explicit "What They DON'T Do" column prevents scope creep.

3. **Note Prefix Conventions** (L717-724): Standardized prefixes (`DOC:`, `TEST:`, `METRIC:`) enable machine parsing.

4. **Evidence Standards by Claim Type** (L216-223): Clear acceptance criteria per claim category.

5. **Completion Criteria** (L548-568): Explicit exit conditions per phase prevent premature advancement.

### Weaknesses

1. **Ambiguous Round-Robin Context**: Lines 82-92 introduce an alternative protocol with different agent counts (6/15/7/3/2) but provide no guidance on when to use it vs. the main 4-phase model. An LLM would not know which to apply.

2. **Implicit Task Dependencies**: The spec shows `T189` depends on `T185,T186,T187,T188`, but the visual flow diagram (L134-141) does not match this. An LLM relying on the diagram would miss dependencies.

3. **Conflicting Agent Counts**: "5 specialist agents" (L13), "5 worker agents" (L104), "6 agents" for mappings (L928), and "7 total" (L163) create confusion. An LLM would struggle to determine the canonical count.

4. **HITL Gate Conditions Overlap**: The conditions in L469-476 are not mutually exclusive. For example, "Any claim contested (3/5 split)" and "Agent outputs contain contradictions" could both apply, with no priority ordering.

5. **Subagent Type Undefined**: The `subagent_type` values (L400-407) are not defined in this document. An LLM would need external documentation to understand what `backend-architect` vs `project-supervisor-orchestrator` means.

### Actionable Improvements

| Issue | Current | Recommended |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Round-Robin clarity | Introduced without context | Add: "For complex investigations requiring extended rigor, use Round-Robin instead of 4-phase model" |
| Agent count consistency | Multiple conflicting values | Use single source: "7 agents total (1 orchestrator + 5 workers + 1 synthesis)" everywhere |
| HITL priority | Conditions listed without order | Number conditions by priority: "(1) Insufficient evidence, (2) Contested claims, (3) Contradictions" |
| Subagent definitions | Referenced but undefined | Add glossary section or link to persona definitions |
| T195 definition | Missing entirely | Add row to Phase 3 Subtasks: `T195 | Synthesis/Consensus Orchestration | phase-3,synthesis` |

---

## 5. Documentation Recommendations

### Critical Fixes (Must Address)

1. **Add T195 Definition**: Create entry in Phase 3 Subtasks table:
   ```markdown
   | T195 | Synthesis Agent Deployment | synthesis,phase-3 |
   ```

2. **Correct File Paths**: Change session recovery instructions:
   ```markdown
   # BEFORE (L581, L763)
   cat claudedocs/CONSENSUS-FRAMEWORK-SPEC.md

   # AFTER
   cat docs/specs/CONSENSUS-FRAMEWORK-SPEC.md
   ```

3. **Fix File Extension Reference**: Change L690 from `.diff` to `.md`:
   ```markdown
   # BEFORE
   claude-todo update T202 --notes "DOC: claudedocs/consensus/doc-corrections.diff"

   # AFTER
   claude-todo update T202 --notes "DOC: claudedocs/consensus/doc-corrections.md"
   ```

### Important Improvements

4. **Expand HITL on First Use** (L234):
   ```markdown
   # BEFORE
   3. If evidence insufficient, escalate to HITL

   # AFTER
   3. If evidence insufficient, escalate to HITL (Human-In-The-Loop gate)
   ```

5. **Clarify Round-Robin Context** (add after L84):
   ```markdown
   > **Note**: The Round-Robin Protocol is an extended alternative to the standard 4-phase model.
   > Use Round-Robin when investigations require adversarial challenge across 5+ domains or
   > when scope exceeds 15 claims. For investigations with fewer than 15 claims, use the
   > standard 4-phase model described in Agent Architecture.
   ```

6. **Standardize Agent Count Language**:
   - L13: Change "5 specialist agents" to "7 agents (5 specialists + orchestrator + synthesis)"
   - L928: Change "6 agents" to "6 subagent type mappings (5 workers + 1 synthesis)"

### Nice-to-Have Enhancements

7. **Add Phase-to-Task Quick Reference**:
   ```markdown
   ### Phase-Task Quick Reference
   | Phase | Parent Task | Subtasks | Output |
   |-------|-------------|----------|--------|
   | 1 | T184 | T185-T188 | phase1-evidence.md |
   | 2 | T189 | T190-T194 | agent-*-findings.md |
   | 3 | T195 | T196-T198 | synthesis-*.md |
   | 4 | T199 | T200-T203 | CONSENSUS-REPORT.md |
   ```

8. **Add Glossary Section** before Changelog:
   ```markdown
   ## Glossary
   | Term | Definition |
   |------|------------|
   | HITL | Human-In-The-Loop gate requiring user decision |
   | subagent_type | Claude agent persona for specialized tasks |
   | R squared | Statistical measure of regression fit quality (0-1 scale) |
   ```

9. **Remove synthesis-round1.md Reference** (L665): File does not exist in actual outputs. Either create the file or update documentation to reflect actual output structure.

## 6. Vote on Documentation Quality

**VOTE**: ADEQUATE

**Confidence**: HIGH

### Rationale

The documentation is structurally sound and provides comprehensive coverage of the consensus framework. The agent prompts are actionable, the output templates are well-defined, and the task tracking integration is thorough.

However, the document contains:
- 2 critical inconsistencies (T195 missing, path errors)
- 3 accuracy issues (file extensions, non-existent files)
- Multiple agent count contradictions that would confuse an LLM

These issues do not invalidate the framework but would cause execution failures if the document is followed literally. The document requires targeted corrections rather than wholesale rewrite.

### Quality Breakdown

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Structure | A | Clear hierarchy, logical flow, good use of tables |
| Accuracy | C | Path errors, missing task definitions, file discrepancies |
| Completeness | B | Most elements present, but T195 gap and missing glossary |
| LLM Clarity | B | Good templates, but ambiguous Round-Robin context |
| Maintainability | A | Changelog present, version tracking, clear update pattern |

**Overall**: The document successfully communicates the framework's intent and structure. An LLM agent could execute the protocol with approximately 80% fidelity. The 20% gap comes from path corrections needed, missing T195 task, and agent count standardization. With the critical fixes applied, this document would merit a GOOD rating.
