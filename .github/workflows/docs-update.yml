# Safety net: catches manual CHANGELOG.md edits that bypass `cleo release ship`.
# Since v0.84.0, `cleo release ship` runs generate-changelog.sh directly (Step 2.5),
# so this workflow is only needed when CHANGELOG.md is edited outside the release flow.

            ## Automated Changelog Update

            This PR was automatically generated because CHANGELOG.md changed
            outside the cleo release ship flow.

            Since v0.84.0, cleo release ship generates platform changelogs
            automatically. This workflow is a safety net for manual edits.
